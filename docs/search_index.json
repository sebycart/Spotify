[["index.html", "Spotify Analysis Chapter 1 Introduction", " Spotify Analysis Sebastian Carter &amp; Yinda Qian 2022-05-05 Chapter 1 Introduction In this project, we explore rap and country music and its listening trends across multiple countries. As hip-hop/rap fans ourselves, we were interested in analyzing the technical features of the music we listen to and comparing it to other genres. As a result, we incorporated country music into our analysis as, on the surface, it has a very different sound and fan base compared to rap music. We were interested in exploring whether the two genres have overlap, or whether they truly are as different as they seem to be. Rap and country music are two very quintessentially American products. Of course, each genre may have its roots in other regions or time periods, but they were truly popularized in the United States over the past few decades. So, we thought it interesting to explore these genres not only in the U.S., but also in other countries in order to understand the ways they have evolved if at all. Given both of our international backgrounds, we are well aware of the influence of American rap music on other country’s pop culture and music industries, so we were excited to explore our theories and experiences using data. In this project, we aim to understand: the primary technical features of rap and country music is there overlap? do their audio features align with the characteristics we associate with each genre? the level of popularity of rap and country across different markets/countries listening trends in each of these countries do other countries mostly listen to American rap or have they developed their own sounds and industries? does language play a role in the popularity of rap music? how music listening trends can reflect cultural differences for example, what does Korea’s style of rap say about their culture? "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources We sourced our data from Spotify’s API. Spotify manages its API and provides extensive documentation on its variables, etc. Generally speaking, the Spotify API is used by developers to collect information on musical artists, songs, albums, etc. The API provides data on specific artists - such as their followers, popularity, discography, etc. - and on the music in whatever form it is in (songs, albums, playlists). The data on the music includes audio features, such as ‘danceability’, ‘energy’, ‘speechiness’, ‘key’, and more. Clearly, many of the features in the Spotify API data are the output of Spotify’s proprietary algorithms – for example, how you measure “danceability” depends on a number of factors that Spotify have chosen at their discretiono. Another variable we used throughout our project was ‘popularity’. Artists have a popularity rating, as do albums and songs. Spotify does not provide any specific details on how their algorithms calculate this metric, however we do know that it is dependent on number of listens as well as how recent those listens are. As with most API’s, many of these metrics are updated continuously – for example, an artist’s number of followers will change, but the audio features of one of their songs will not. All of the information we are able to pull from the API is the latest data, i.e. we cannot see historical data, such as how an artist’s popularity has changed over time. In this project we used the SpotifyR package to pull data from the API. SpotifyR is a very useful R wrapper for the Spotify Web API. The package was last updated in November 2021 and it contains a number of useful functions that streamlined the data collection process of this project. The primary functions we used were the following: get_genre_artists() This function pulls the most popular artists (as determined by Spotify) in a specific genre and market (country). We used this function to pull the 20 most popular rap and country artists across 8 different markets. Each row in this data equates to an artist. get_artist_top_tracks() This function allows you to pull the top/most popular tracks of an artist (you can choose the number of tracks). We fed in the artist id’s from the get_genre_artists() data and got the top 10 tracks for each of the top 20 rap artists in each country – around 200 tracks for each of the 8 countries country (1600 rap songs total). So in this dataset each row equates to a track/song. Each song has information on its release date, which album its in (if its on an album), its popularity, its duration, the artists on the track, whether it’s explicit or not, and more. get_audio_features() This function was useful in getting the audio features of each track. Each track has audio data such as danceability, loudness, acousticness, energy, and more. After using these functions, we have a few main datasets. The rap and country datasets have around 1600 rows each and each row is a different song. Within these datasets, we have 200 songs for 8 countries, i.e. the top rappers and country artist’s top songs. We chose 8 different markets to explore and we aimed to cover a variety of languages, regions and cultures. We chose USA, Great Britain, Mexico, India, Japan, Korea, France, and Ghana. We were limited to countries that have Spotify of course, so that is why China was not included. Moreover, we picked Ghana because, as far as African countries go, Spotify is popular there. And we picked Mexico for a similar reason. As stated earlier, the API does not provide historical data, which would have been useful in our analysis. Other than this shortcoming, there are no known problems with this data. Of course, when using the Spotify data for analysis, one must be aware that many metrics are the results of Spotify’s proprietary algorithms. Below is a handful of the variables that Spotify provides for each track/artist: Audio Features acousticness measure from 0 to 1 of how acoustic a track is danceability measure of how suitable a track is for dancing to relies on factors such as tempo and beat strength 0 is not danceable, 1 is danceable energy measure from 0 to 1 energetic tracks are loud, fast, noisy instrumentalness proportional to the % of track that contains vocals valence describes the “positiveness” of a track Track Features release date album.type how the song was released e.g. part of an album, as a single, etc explicit logical variable does the song contain explicit language duration length of a track in milliseconds restrictions logical variable denotes whether a track is subject to restrictions Artist Features popularity measured fromo 0 to 100 (least to most popular) factors in the popularity of the artist’s discography uses listening history as well as how recent those listens are followers total number of Spotify followers For a peak into the data, see below the first five tracks in our main dataset. ## X disc_number duration_ms explicit ## 1 1 1 120026 TRUE ## 2 2 1 110886 TRUE ## 3 3 1 119133 TRUE ## href ## 1 https://api.spotify.com/v1/tracks/5TXDeTFVRVY7Cvt0Dw4vWW ## 2 https://api.spotify.com/v1/tracks/2ZRo7axmMPeSVUvDbGkJah ## 3 https://api.spotify.com/v1/tracks/7m9OqQk4RVRkw9JJdeAw96 ## id is_local is_playable name popularity ## 1 5TXDeTFVRVY7Cvt0Dw4vWW FALSE TRUE Revenge 84 ## 2 2ZRo7axmMPeSVUvDbGkJah FALSE TRUE Hope 83 ## 3 7m9OqQk4RVRkw9JJdeAw96 FALSE TRUE Jocelyn Flores 82 ## preview_url ## 1 https://p.scdn.co/mp3-preview/f5096665f4f47142d704ee0ce47a8df26d256ad8?cid=2c522ebeb84f4aa189ec93288a41d97f ## 2 &lt;NA&gt; ## 3 https://p.scdn.co/mp3-preview/99ae2de8b5e6c95349a9775948f65a331ca2a329?cid=2c522ebeb84f4aa189ec93288a41d97f ## track_number type uri album.album_type ## 1 5 track spotify:track:5TXDeTFVRVY7Cvt0Dw4vWW album ## 2 16 track spotify:track:2ZRo7axmMPeSVUvDbGkJah album ## 3 2 track spotify:track:7m9OqQk4RVRkw9JJdeAw96 album ## album.href ## 1 https://api.spotify.com/v1/albums/5VdyJkLe3yvOs0l4xXbWp0 ## 2 https://api.spotify.com/v1/albums/2Ti79nwTsont5ZHfdxIzAm ## 3 https://api.spotify.com/v1/albums/5VdyJkLe3yvOs0l4xXbWp0 ## album.id album.name album.release_date ## 1 5VdyJkLe3yvOs0l4xXbWp0 17 2017-08-25 ## 2 2Ti79nwTsont5ZHfdxIzAm ? 2018-03-16 ## 3 5VdyJkLe3yvOs0l4xXbWp0 17 2017-08-25 ## album.release_date_precision album.total_tracks album.type ## 1 day 11 album ## 2 day 18 album ## 3 day 11 album ## album.uri ## 1 spotify:album:5VdyJkLe3yvOs0l4xXbWp0 ## 2 spotify:album:2Ti79nwTsont5ZHfdxIzAm ## 3 spotify:album:5VdyJkLe3yvOs0l4xXbWp0 ## album.external_urls.spotify external_ids.isrc ## 1 https://open.spotify.com/album/5VdyJkLe3yvOs0l4xXbWp0 USUYG1156895 ## 2 https://open.spotify.com/album/2Ti79nwTsont5ZHfdxIzAm USUG11800447 ## 3 https://open.spotify.com/album/5VdyJkLe3yvOs0l4xXbWp0 USUYG1156892 ## external_urls.spotify genre country ## 1 https://open.spotify.com/track/5TXDeTFVRVY7Cvt0Dw4vWW rap IN ## 2 https://open.spotify.com/track/2ZRo7axmMPeSVUvDbGkJah rap IN ## 3 https://open.spotify.com/track/7m9OqQk4RVRkw9JJdeAw96 rap IN ## restrictions.reason ## 1 &lt;NA&gt; ## 2 &lt;NA&gt; ## 3 &lt;NA&gt; Also see below the full set of audio features that Spotify calculates and provides for each track.

Then, we conducted data manipulation and transformation to rework the data into a form we could use. In order to compare rap and country music listening trends across 8 different markets, we needed to use the get_genre_artists() function to pull the top artists in each market and genre, and then we needed get_artist_top_tracks() to get the top artists’ most popular tracks. To streamline this process, we created a function to read in the artist data, then pull each artist ID, which was then inputted into the get_artist_top_tracks(). This function required providing the country’s ISO code – for example Mexico’s ISO code is “MX”. So, we created 16 datasets using the function, one for rap and one for country for each market (2 x 8). Each dataset contains around 200 songs. The reason they do not contain exactly 200 songs is that the top artists tend to work with one another, so one artists most popular song might also be another artist’s most popular song. So we removed duplicate songs so as to not skew the data analysis. After we created the 16 datasets, we used rbind to bind them together and create our main dataset, which we used for most of the plots. This dataset includes information on each track and its artist – such as its popularity, release date, album name, its position in the album, whether it was released as a single or part of an album and more. The function below is included for explanation purposes. First, it calls the top rap artists in a given market. Then, it iterates through that dataset and pulls each artist ID. The artist ID is inputted into the get_artist_top_tracks() function to pull that artist’s most popular songs. Then, the result is a dataset for a given market with around 200 rap songs popular in a market, such as Ghana, Mexico, etc. rap_toptracks = function(countrycode){ rap = get_genre_artists(genre = &quot;rap&quot;, market = countrycode) for(i in 1:nrow(rap)){ rapid = rap$id[i] artist_top_tracks = get_artist_top_tracks(rapid, market = countrycode) if(i ==1){ rap_topartist_toptracks = artist_top_tracks } else{ rap_topartist_toptracks = rbind(rap_topartist_toptracks,artist_top_tracks) } } As will be discussed more later, Korea did not output any songs when we used the genre name “rap”, therefore we had to use “k-rap” to get the most popular rappers in Korea. After cleaning, tidying, and transforming our data, we exported our datasets into csv files so that the data would not change and be different to our interactive plot. As a result, our data is current up until 4 May, 2022. We have stored these clean datasets in docs/. The Spotify data omits certain data which would be very helpful in this analysis and other explorations. For example, we lack detailed information on the artists - where they were born, their record labels, their nationality, gender, age, etc. Moreover, the Spotify API provides only very high level information on tracks and artists – for example we are not able to access data on the number of followers or listens by country. Interestingly, some of this data is available on the artist’s Spotify profile, but it is not accessible via the API. Another major limitation of this data is that we do not get any insight on the listeners’ demographics – for example, their age would be very helpful in finding trends. Another feature that would have been helpful is the language of the music – for example, just because an artist is popular in Mexico does not necessarily mean the music is in Spanish. All of the data cleaning and transformation steps can be found here. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values Fortunately, our dataset does not have too many NA’s where it matters. As we obtained our data through Spotify’s API, most of the variables we are interested in contain information on an artist or a song. This information is the most current data available - including the popularity of an artist or the audio features of a song. Most of these variables are generated by Spotify automatically, and therefore we rarely see unavailable data. The following NA analysis is conducted on our main dataset that brings together the most popular rap and country songs across 8 different markets. Each row is a different track, and for each track we have information on its popularity, audio features, release date, song length, etc. In the following plot, we can see two columns that are populated with NA’s (marked as yellow). The column that is almost entirely NA values is the restrictions.reason variable. The other column with NA’s is the preview_url column, which basically contains a url with a preview of each track. Clearly, many tracks do not have such information, and this is likely due to music rights and/or label restrictions. Clearly there is an issue with the restrictions.reason column. This variable indicates whether a track is subject to restrictions in a given market. The plot below breaks down the number of NA’s per market (8 total), and it clearly shows Korea has the least amount of NA’s whereas the others only have NA’s. Korea has restrictions on certain explicit music (we will discuss this more later on), so we can conclude that if a track has an NA value, then the market doesn’t have a restriction, whereas if there is an NA value we can predict the track was released in the Korean market. The following plot shows that there are no complete rows, but that the NA’s are only present in three variables. In the top plot, we see close to 100% of rows are missing data in the restrictions.reason column, and almost 50% of rows are missing data in the preview_url column. In the main plot, we can see the different patterns. First, we see 50% of rows are missing data only in the restrictions.reason column. Next, we see around 40% of rows are missing data in both columns. After that, the patterns are preset amongst a very small subset of data. For example, it seems around 5% of rows are missing in the first and third column (the date column). Clearly, the first two columns see the most NA’s and the most common patterns involve one or both of the first two columns. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results", " Chapter 5 Results To start our analysis, we want to explore similarities and differences across the two genres of focus, rap and country. We constructed a biplot to explore how audio features play different roles in these two genres. This plot contains the most popular rap and country songs globally – each dot represents a song. In this plot, two clusters are formed – the two genres – and there is minimal overlap. In rap, speechiness is a key characteristic. As defined by Spotify, speechiness means the presence of spoken words in a track. Other features, such as liveness and danceability are strongly associated with rap. In country music on the other hand, mode is an important characteristic. The mode, is the vocabulary of a melody, specifying which notes can be used and indicates which have special importance. As expected, acousticness also plays an important role in country music, as does valence. Acousticness is a confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic and valence describes the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (sad, depressed, angry). From this biplot we can see that typically country tracks are more associated with happy, cheerful sounds whereas features like danceability influence rap. It is interesting to see such a clear bifurcation between rap and country music and some preconceived notions about the two genres were validated here. In this plot, we can see how variables are connected and again we see clustering in some of the variables. To start, again we observe danceability is high amongst rap songs and low for country songs. It is interesting to see how danceability and energy seem to have an inverse relationship – i.e. the more danceable songs seem to be lower energy and vice versa. Again we see some strong clustering around the speechiness and acousticness variables, as rap songs seem to have higher speechiness and lower acousticness compared to country music. Interestingly, rap and country seem to have alignment in terms of instrumentalness, despite the difference in speechiness. Finally, we see how there is high variation in the last few variables - liveness, valence, tempo – and there are no clear trends between rap and country music. Again, this plot serves to set a baseline in our analysis of these two industries - they share some similaries - e.g. instrumentalness, key - and there are some clear differences - in particular, danceability, acousticness. In this plot, we begin to explore listening trends through the popularity variable. Popularity is measured on a scale of 0-100 (least to most popular) and it is a factor of number of listens and how recent those listens are. We chose the most popular rap and country songs worldwide and used their popularity rating (which is a global rating). First, we see a difference in popularity between rap and country music. The top rap songs typically have a rating of around 75-80 whereas the top country songs are around 65-70. It is also interesting to see the difference in the range of popularity. The most popular rap song has a rating in the 90s and the less popular tracks are still above 50. In the country genre, the most popular songs don’t reach 90 and the least popular go as far down as 40. Next, we decided to break down the most popular songs by whether or not they are explicit. We typically associate rap music with more explicit language and content, especially compared to country music. As a result, one would expect that rap fans don’t hold clean songs in high regard and country fans don’t love explicit country songs. But in this plot, we see that there are quite a few non-explicit rap songs that are very popular and very popular country songs that are explicit. This goes against our preconceived notions about the rap and country industries and their fan bases. Clearly, there is a desensitization to explicit language across genres. Now that we have a good baseline understanding of rap and country’s technical features, their overall popularity on Spotify, we will explore these genres in different markets. So, we’ve taken the top 20 rap and country artists in each genre and market, and then we’ve taken their 10 most popular songs (in each genre and market). So, for each genre and country, we have 200 of the most popular tracks. To start, we can see the most popular rap songs tend to be explicit and the most popular country songs are actually rarely explicit. It is interesting to see the similarities across markets in terms of the most popular country songs. Rap however tells a different story. We see that most of the popular rap songs in the US, Ghana, UK, France and India are explicit. Korea and Japan on the other hand seem to listen to non-explicit rap songs. This is an interesting reflection of cultures, namely that Japanese and Korean mainstream culture is more conservative than the Western countries. In fact, one of the reasons that Korea’s music is rarely explicit is because there is a law in Korea that restricts certain explicit content if the audience is under 19. As a result, it is likely that musicians and record labels wish to avoid listening restrictions and keep their music clean. Now, that we have uncovered a trend amongst Asian countries, we are interested in exploring further the countries that seem to have similar listening trends to the States. In this plot, we see the release date of the most popular rap and country songs. Starting with the rap genre, we see that France, Korea, and Japan listen the most to recently released rap songs. The rest of the nations seem to have very similar patterns, which is that they mostly listen to recent songs but also like older (20 to 30 year old rap songs). We believe that this reflects more recently developed rap industries in France, Korea and Japan. The United States, on the other hand, has had a thriving rap scene for decades and one can see that some of the most popular rap songs were released before 2000. Even though rap music is more popular now in America than ever before, Americans are still listening to older rappers. The data we gathered is up-to-date, so we can conclude that for English speaking countries, they have accumulated an audience of hip hop fans. For example, these people will still listening to Eminem and Kanye’s tracks released 20 years ago. On the other side, the non-English speaking countries like Japan, Korea, and France, these countries have only recently developed their own rap music and industry and still building their fan base. Interestingly, in analyzing the country music listening trends, we see that countries like Mexico and France seem to listen to very old country music – even going back as far as 1960. The United States seems to be the only nation that almost exclusively listens to post 1990 country music. This likely reflects the popularity of country music today, and how country music fans listen to recently released music, whereas country fans in other nations are probably not as tapped into the modern country music scene as it is much less popular in their markets. In the plot above, we show how the average length of a rap song differs across markets and varies by its type of release. The type of release refers to how a track was “published” – either as part of an album or as a single. Interestingly, we see that the average length of a popular rap song that was released within an album is typically longer than a single track. This makes sense as single tracks typically a precursor to an album and are meant to be catchy and build hype, whereas album tracks are typically longer and part of a broader work and sound. In fact, the only two countries that see the opposite trend are France and Korea. These are the two countries we had previously identified as having very flourishing, but young rap industries. The fact that they tend to have album tracks of shorter length, and single tracks of longer length, speaks to the fact that their industries are less established and therefore do not follow the trends of the other industries. For example, we saw in the previous plot how Mexico follows the listening patterns of the United States – they listen to a mix of older and newer rap songs even though they have many local artists. This is because their industry is more established (possibly due to their proximity and connection to the United States). However, France and Korea mostly listen to very new rap songs, and now we see that their rap tracks follow very different trends to their older, more established counterparts. The plot above demonstrates not only how much rap has exploded in terms of popularity in Korea, but it shows that other countries have not developed their own rap industries/celebrities/culture. K-rap, which refers to “Korean-rap” clearly is very popular in Korea, with the most popular artists in the 60-80 range. Although the Korean rap artists have a smaller following than the US they easily exceed that of their Indian counterparts. Although Spotify has a genre specifically for Indian rap (aptly named “Indian-rap”), its artists are extremely unpopular with their ratings in the 20 to 50 range. Their numbers of followers are also all near zero. A few Korean rappers on the other hand are almost at 10 million followers and many others are over 1 million. This plot demonstrates how rap music has proliferated in some nations, and even developed its own scene, whereas other nations have not yet created their own mainstream rap genre. Now, looking at the top 20 rap artists across each of the 8 countries. We see that France, Korea and Japan in particular have developed their own rap industries and scenes. The most popular rappers in these countries produce and release music locally. This matches what we saw earlier, which is that the most popular rap songs in these three nations are all much more recent, and Korean and Japanese songs are notably non-explicit. This plot also helps explain why other countries like Britain, India and Ghana follow very similar listening trends to the United States, which is that they have not developed their own rap genre and therefore are still heavily connected to American rap. Between the group of countries that listen to their own rappers and the countries that listen to foreign rappers, Mexico seems to have its own unique rap trends. Obviously, since Mexico is a Spanish-speaking nation, it is natural for Mexicans to gravitate towards Spanish rappers. However, due to its proximity to the US, we believe it is influenced by American pop culture and so we predict that the 40% of local artists are Mexican or Latin-America based, and the rest of 60% non-local artists are from the US. We will uncover the answer in the interactive section. In this plot, we examine how many Spotify followers each countries most popular rappers have. This plot will help us understand how big the rap fan bases of other nations. To start, in Japan, France, and Korea, we can see that their native rappers have a small amount of followers relative to American rappers for example. However, in comparing Japanese and Korean rappers, we see that Korean rappers tend to have more following, which would indicate that it is more integrated in Korean pop culture. ALthough most of the popular rappers in Japan are native, they actually have a very low following. France on the other hand has mostly French rappers and they seem to be growing in popularity, like those in Korea. It is interesting to see in Great Britain how even though they have a British rapper in their list of most popular rappers, this rapper has an extremely small following in comparison. This speaks to the fact that American rappers have global following, whereas Korean, French, and Japanese rappers in particular are only really popular in their nations. English is spoken in Ghana, India, the US, and the UK. People in these countries have more exposure to English rap songs and seem to listen to the most popular American rappers. For example, the rapper with the most followers in Ghana, India, the UK, the US, and Mexico is Drake and this is why Drake accumulates tremendous amount of followers, way more that rappers based on their minor languages. We have made an interactive version of this plot (in the Interactive component section). Now that we have seen how some countries have developed their own rap industries, and others still rely on the American industry, we have decided to come full circle and compare the technical features of the emerging rap industries. We have chosen France and Korea as they seem to have more developed and popular rap genres that have emerged in the past few years. In this plot, each point represents one of the top rap songs in its respective market. We see clustering of French tracks in the bottom half and Korean tracks in the top half. The French tracks are more associated with danceability, instrumentalness and speechiness, whereas the Korean tracks are more high energy and loud. There is certainly overlap in the middle which makes sense as the industries are still developing and probably will change more in the coming years. Interestingly, the most popular American songs seem to be scattered all over the plot. Perhaps this reflects the influence of American rap globally, not only in terms of popularity in other nations but on its impact on the sounds of emerging rap industries across the globe.

"],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion This analysis was very interesting and exciting for us as music fans. First, it was fascinating to explore the technical features of a song and to see how music can be quantified and measured in terms of energy, joy, and danceability to name a few. We found that country and rap songs tend to be influenced by different features, however there is certainly overlap in other areas. For example, while country music may have higher acousticness and rap is more danceable, they vary in their valence (which is a measure of joy). We found it interesting to see how much variation there is across tracks in terms of tempo and energy, but factors like instrumentalness had little to no variation. All of this helped us set a baseline in our next explorations which largely focused on listening trends in these genres. We made use of the popularity variable which helped serve as a proxy for listening trends across different markets in different industries. We uncovered interesting insights abroad, namely that foreign nations like France, Korea and Japan have taken American rap and created their own industries and sounds. We saw how these three countries mostly listen to very recent rap songs, and their most popular rappers are typically local. We also found that not only do French and Korean listeners have different listening trends to the United States’ listeners (in that they mostly listen to very recently released songs), but French and Korean rappers also employ different techniques (in that their album tracks are shorter than their single tracks). Both of these facts reflects two very young and developing rap scenes, which are certainly growing in popularity and evolving with time. However, on the flip side, it was also clear that other countries have not developed their own rap industries and almost exclusively listen to American rap music. In fact, when we looked into Indian rap for example, we found very low popularity/traction and the artists had very few followers. This is a very important statement for a population of over 1 billion people. We also looked at how these countries have differing listening patterns. For example, we saw that Korean and Japanese rap music, while very clearly a part of their respective pop cultures, have maintained the conservative elements of their societies. French rap, on the other hand, is mostly comprised of French artists who release explicit music. Clearly, explicit music is the norm in the West. This fact connects back to the analysis of the explicit country songs and how they were just as, if not more, popular than clean country songs. Finally, when we analyzed the younger, yet rapidly developing rap industries - particularly the French and Korean markets - we found a broad American influence and yet clearly each country had developed their own sound. It is interesting to see how this American music genre has spread across the globe and evolved to match the tastes of other cultures and societies. Although we certainly found significant value in the Spotify API, there were certainly limitations that we had to deal with. To start, Spotify did not provide extensive information on the artists - such as their age, nationality, language, etc. - and they did not provide any information on the Spotify listeners. Instead, we had to use popularity as a proxy for listening trends. Moreover, Spotify only provides the most recent/up-to-date information, as opposed to historical information that could be used to see changing trends and trajectories. Once again, we had to use what information was at our disposal, such as combining release dates and popularity, to understand the nature of the emerging rap industries worldwide.
