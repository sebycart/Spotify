As we obtain our data through Spotify’s API, most of the variables we are interested in contain information on an artist or a song. This information is the most current data available - say the number of the popularity of an artist or the audio features of a song. Most of these variables are generated by Spotify automatically, and therefore we rarely see unavailable data. The following NA analysis is conducted on our main dataset that brings together the most popular rap and country songs across 8 different markets. Each row is a different track, and for each track we have information on its popularity, audio features, release date, song length, etc. In the following plot, we can see two columns that are populated with NA’s (marked as yellow). The column that is almost entirely NA values is the restrictions.reason variable. The other column with NA’s is the preview_url column, which basically contains a url with a preview of each track. Clearly, many tracks do not have such information, and this is likely due to music rights and/or label restrictions. Clearly there is an issue with the restrictions.reason column. This variable indicates whether a track is subject to restrictions in a given market. The plot below breaks down the number of NA’s per market (8 total), and it clearly shows Korea has the least amount of NA’s whereas the others only have NA’s. As it turns out, Korea has restrictions on certain explicit music (we will discuss this more later on). The following plot shows that there are no complete rows, but that the NA’s come from only two variables. On the right we see that almost 60% of rows are missing data only in the restrictions.reason column, almost 50% of rows are missing data in both columns, and a very small amount are missing data in only the preview_url column.
