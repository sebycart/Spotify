As hip-hop/rap fans ourselves, we were interested in analyzing the technical features of the music we listen to and comparing it to other genres. As a result, we incorporated country music into our analysis as, on the surface, it has a very different sound and fan base compared to rap music. We were interested in exploring whether the two genres have overlap, or whether they truly are as different as they seem to be. Rap and country music are two very quintessentially American products. Of course, each genre may have its roots in other regions or time periods, but they were truly popularized in the United States over the past few decades. So, we thought it interesting to explore these genres not only in the U.S., but also in other countries in order to understand the ways they have evolved if at all. Given both of our international backgrounds, we are well aware of the influence of American rap music on other country’s pop culture and music industries, so we were excited to explore our theories and experiences using data. In this project, we aim to understand the primary technical features of rap and country music is there overlap? do their audio features align with the characteristics we associate with each genre? the level of popularity of rap and country across different markets/countries listening trends in each of these countries do other countries mostly listen to American rap or have they developed their own sounds and industries? does language play a role in the popularity of rap music? how music listening trends can reflect cultural differences for example, what does Korea’s style of rap say about their culture "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources We sourced our data from Spotify’s API. Spotify manages its API and provides extensive documentation on its variables, etc. Generally speaking, the Spotify API is used by developers to collect information on musical artists, songs, albums, etc. The API provides data on specific artists - such as their followers, popularity, discography, etc. - and on the music in whatever form it is in (songs, albums, playlists). The data on the music includes audio features, such as ‘danceability’, ‘energy’, ‘speechiness’, ‘key’, and more. Clearly, many of the features in the Spotify API data are the output of Spotify’s proprietary algorithms – for example, how you measure “danceability” depends on a number of factors that Spotify have chosen at their discretiono. Another variable we used throughout our project was ‘popularity’. Artists have a popularity rating, as do albums and songs. Spotify does not provide any specific details on how their algorithms calculate this metric, however we do know that it is dependent on number of listens as well as how recent those listens are. As with most API’s, many of these metrics are updated continuously – for example, an artist’s number of followers will change, but the audio features of one of their songs will not. All of the information we are able to pull from the API is the latest data, i.e. we cannot see historical data, such as how an artist’s popularity has changed over time. In this project we used the SpotifyR package to pull data from the API. SpotifyR is a very useful R wrapper for the Spotify Web API. The package was last updated in November 2021 and it contains a number of useful functions that streamlined the data collection process of this project. The primary functions we used were the following: get_genre_artists() This function pulls the most popular artists (as determined by Spotify) in a specific genre and market (country). We used this function to pull the 20 most popular rap and country artists across 8 different markets. Each row in this data equates to an artist. get_artist_top_tracks() This function allows you to pull the top/most popular tracks of an artist (you can choose the number of tracks). We fed in the artist id’s from the get_genre_artists() data and got the top 10 tracks for each of the top 20 rap artists in each country – around 200 tracks for each of the 8 countries country (1600 rap songs total). So in this dataset each row equates to a track/song. Each song has information on its release date, which album its in (if its on an album), its popularity, its duration, the artists on the track, whether it’s explicit or not, and more. get_audio_features() This function was useful in getting the audio features of each track. Each track has audio data such as danceability, loudness, acousticness, energy, and more. After using these functions, we have a few main datasets. The rap and country datasets have around 1600 rows each and each row is a different song. Within these datasets, we have 200 songs for 8 countries, i.e. the top rappers and country artist’s top songs. We chose 8 different markets to explore and we aimed to cover a variety of languages, regions and cultures. We chose USA, Great Britain, Mexico, India, Japan, Korea, France, and Ghana. We were limited to countries that have Spotify of course, so that is why China was not included. Moreover, we picked Ghana because, as far as African countries go, Spotify is popular there. And we picked Mexico for a similar reason. As stated earlier, the API does not provide historical data, which would have been useful in our analysis. Other than this shortcoming, there are no known problems with this data. Of course, when using the Spotify data for analysis, one must be aware that many metrics are the results of Spotify’s proprietary algorithms. Below is a handful of the variables that Spotify provides for each track/artist: Audio Features acousticness measure from 0 to 1 of how acoustic a track is danceability measure of how suitable a track is for dancing to relies on factors such as tempo and beat strength 0 is not danceable, 1 is danceable energy measure from 0 to 1 energetic tracks are loud, fast, noisy instrumentalness proportional to the % of track that contains vocals valence describes the “positiveness” of a track Track Features release date album.type how the song was released e.g. part of an album, as a single, etc explicit logical variable does the song contain explicit language duration length of a track in milliseconds restrictions logical variable denotes whether a track is subject to restrictions Artist Features popularity measured fromo 0 to 100 (least to most popular) factors in the popularity of the artist’s discography uses listening history as well as how recent those listens are followers total number of Spotify followers For a peak into the data, see below the first five tracks in our main dataset. ## X disc_number duration_ms explicit ## 1 1 1 120026 TRUE ## 2 2 1 110886 TRUE ## 3 3 1 119133 TRUE ## href ## 1 https://api.spotify.com/v1/tracks/5TXDeTFVRVY7Cvt0Dw4vWW ## 2 https://api.spotify.com/v1/tracks/2ZRo7axmMPeSVUvDbGkJah ## 3 https://api.spotify.com/v1/tracks/7m9OqQk4RVRkw9JJdeAw96 ## id is_local is_playable name popularity ## 1 5TXDeTFVRVY7Cvt0Dw4vWW FALSE TRUE Revenge 84 ## 2 2ZRo7axmMPeSVUvDbGkJah FALSE TRUE Hope 83 ## 3 7m9OqQk4RVRkw9JJdeAw96 FALSE TRUE Jocelyn Flores 82 ## preview_url ## 1 https://p.scdn.co/mp3-preview/f5096665f4f47142d704ee0ce47a8df26d256ad8?cid=2c522ebeb84f4aa189ec93288a41d97f ## 2 &lt;NA&gt; ## 3 https://p.scdn.co/mp3-preview/99ae2de8b5e6c95349a9775948f65a331ca2a329?cid=2c522ebeb84f4aa189ec93288a41d97f ## track_number type uri album.album_type ## 1 5 track spotify:track:5TXDeTFVRVY7Cvt0Dw4vWW album ## 2 16 track spotify:track:2ZRo7axmMPeSVUvDbGkJah album ## 3 2 track spotify:track:7m9OqQk4RVRkw9JJdeAw96 album ## album.href ## 1 https://api.spotify.com/v1/albums/5VdyJkLe3yvOs0l4xXbWp0 ## 2 https://api.spotify.com/v1/albums/2Ti79nwTsont5ZHfdxIzAm ## 3 https://api.spotify.com/v1/albums/5VdyJkLe3yvOs0l4xXbWp0 ## album.id album.name album.release_date ## 1 5VdyJkLe3yvOs0l4xXbWp0 17 2017-08-25 ## 2 2Ti79nwTsont5ZHfdxIzAm ? 2018-03-16 ## 3 5VdyJkLe3yvOs0l4xXbWp0 17 2017-08-25 ## album.release_date_precision album.total_tracks album.type ## 1 day 11 album ## 2 day 18 album ## 3 day 11 album ## album.uri ## 1 spotify:album:5VdyJkLe3yvOs0l4xXbWp0 ## 2 spotify:album:2Ti79nwTsont5ZHfdxIzAm ## 3 spotify:album:5VdyJkLe3yvOs0l4xXbWp0 ## album.external_urls.spotify external_ids.isrc ## 1 https://open.spotify.com/album/5VdyJkLe3yvOs0l4xXbWp0 USUYG1156895 ## 2 https://open.spotify.com/album/2Ti79nwTsont5ZHfdxIzAm USUG11800447 ## 3 https://open.spotify.com/album/5VdyJkLe3yvOs0l4xXbWp0 USUYG1156892 ## external_urls.spotify genre country ## 1 https://open.spotify.com/track/5TXDeTFVRVY7Cvt0Dw4vWW rap IN ## 2 https://open.spotify.com/track/2ZRo7axmMPeSVUvDbGkJah rap IN ## 3 https://open.spotify.com/track/7m9OqQk4RVRkw9JJdeAw96 rap IN ## restrictions.reason ## 1 &lt;NA&gt; ## 2 &lt;NA&gt; ## 3 &lt;NA&gt; Also see below the full set of audio features that Spotify calculates and provides for each track.

Then, we conducted data manipulation and transformation to rework the data into a form we could use. In order to compare rap and country music listening trends across 8 different markets, we needed to use the get_genre_artists() function to pull the top artists in each market and genre, and then we needed get_artist_top_tracks() to get the top artists’ most popular tracks. To streamline this process, we created a function to read in the artist data, then pull each artist ID, which was then inputted into the get_artist_top_tracks(). This function required providing the country’s ISO code – for example Mexico’s ISO code is “MX”. So, we created 16 datasets using the function, one for rap and one for country for each market (2 x 8). Each dataset contains around 200 songs. The reason they do not contain exactly 200 songs is that the top artists tend to work with one another, so one artists most popular song might also be another artist’s most popular song. So we removed duplicate songs so as to not skew the data analysis. After we created the 16 datasets, we used rbind to bind them together and create our main dataset, which we used for most of the plots. This dataset includes information on each track and its artist – such as its popularity, release date, album name, its position in the album, whether it was released as a single or part of an album and more. The function below is included for explanation purposes. First, it calls the top rap artists in a given market. Then, it iterates through that dataset and pulls each artist ID. The artist ID is inputted into the get_artist_top_tracks() function to pull that artist’s most popular songs. Then, the result is a dataset for a given market with around 200 rap songs popular in a market, such as Ghana, Mexico, etc. rap_toptracks = function(countrycode){ rap = get_genre_artists(genre = &quot;rap&quot;, market = countrycode) for(i in 1:nrow(rap)){ rapid = rap$id[i] artist_top_tracks = get_artist_top_tracks(rapid, market = countrycode) if(i ==1){ rap_topartist_toptracks = artist_top_tracks } else{ rap_topartist_toptracks = rbind(rap_topartist_toptracks,artist_top_tracks) } } As will be discussed more later, Korea did not output any songs when we used the genre name “rap”, therefore we had to use “k-rap” to get the most popular rappers in Korea. After cleaning, tidying, and transforming our data, we exported our datasets into csv files so that the data would not change and be different to our interactive plot. As a result, our data is current up until 4 May, 2022. We have stored these clean datasets in docs/. The Spotify data omits certain data which would be very helpful in this analysis and other explorations. For example, we lack detailed information on the artists - where they were born, their record labels, their nationality, gender, age, etc. Moreover, the Spotify API provides only very high level information on tracks and artists – for example we are not able to access data on the number of followers or listens by country. Interestingly, some of this data is available on the artist’s Spotify profile, but it is not accessible via the API. Another major limitation of this data is that we do not get any insight on the listeners’ demographics – for example, their age would be very helpful in finding trends. Another feature that would have been helpful is the language of the music – for example, just because an artist is popular in Mexico does not necessarily mean the music is in Spanish. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values Fortunately, our dataset does not have too many NA’s where it matters. As we obtained our data through Spotify’s API, most of the variables we are interested in contain information on an artist or a song. This information is the most current data available - including the popularity of an artist or the audio features of a song. Most of these variables are generated by Spotify automatically, and therefore we rarely see unavailable data. The following NA analysis is conducted on our main dataset that brings together the most popular rap and country songs across 8 different markets. Each row is a different track, and for each track we have information on its popularity, audio features, release date, song length, etc. In the following plot, we can see two columns that are populated with NA’s (marked as yellow). The column that is almost entirely NA values is the restrictions.reason variable. The other column with NA’s is the preview_url column, which basically contains a url with a preview of each track. Clearly, many tracks do not have such information, and this is likely due to music rights and/or label restrictions. Clearly there is an issue with the restrictions.reason column. This variable indicates whether a track is subject to restrictions in a given market. The plot below breaks down the number of NA’s per market (8 total), and it clearly shows Korea has the least amount of NA’s whereas the others only have NA’s. Korea has restrictions on certain explicit music (we will discuss this more later on), so we can conclude that if a track has an NA value, then the market doesn’t have a restriction, whereas if there is an NA value we can predict the track was released in the Korean market. The following plot shows that there are no complete rows, but that the NA’s are only present in three variables. In the top plot, we see close to 100% of rows are missing data in the restrictions.reason column, and almost 50% of rows are missing data in the preview_url column. In the main plot, we can see the different patterns. First, we see 50% of rows are missing data only in the restrictions.reason column. Next, we see around 40% of rows are missing data in both columns. After that, the patterns are preset amongst a very small subset of data. For example, it seems around 5% of rows are missing in the first and third column (the date column). Clearly, the first two columns see the most NA’s and the most common patterns involve one or both of the first two columns.
