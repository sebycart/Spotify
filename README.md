In this project, we will be using the Spotify API to explore listening trends globally and analyze the composition and features of songs across genres and artists. We are keen to understand how technical music features influence popularity and we aim to compare and contrast the composition of various genres. Spotify has defined and quantified metrics such as "danceability", "energy", and "loudness", and we hope to extract interesting trends out of all of the noise (pun intended).
